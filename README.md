# Healthcare Workforce Mental Health 

Healthcare organizations face significant challenges in retaining staff and ensuring employee well-being. High stress levels, burnout, and low job satisfaction are major contributors to workforce turnover, impacting patient care and organizational efficiency. This case study uses the Healthcare Workforce Mental Health Dataset to analyze these challenges and recommend actionable solutions.

## Data Defenition:

- Workplace Factor: The primary workplace challenge experienced by the employee (e.g., Heavy Workload, Poor Work Environment).
- Stress Level: A score from 1 to 10 representing the employee's stress level, infl uenced by their workplace factors.
- Burnout Frequency: A categorical variable describing the frequency of burnout experienced: Never, Occasionally, Often
- Job Satisfaction: A score from 1 to 5 indicating how satisfi ed the employee is with their job: 1 - Very Dissatisfied, 5 - Very Satisfied

## Key Findings
1. Burnout Frequency by Role:
 - Registered Nurses and Critical Care Nurses experience the highest burnout rates due to Heavy Workload and Emotional Demands.
2. Stress Level and Job Satisfaction:
 - Employees with stress levels ≥8 report low job satisfaction (scores ≤2).
 - Burnout frequency ("Often") correlates with dissatisfaction.
3. Turnover Intention:
 - Employees with low job satisfaction (≤2) and high stress levels (≥8) are 70% more likely to indicate turnover intention.
4. Impact of EAP Access:
 - Employees with access to Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) take fewer mental health absences and report slightly higher satisfaction.
